# Check camera permissions
# Try different browsers
# Ensure no other apps using camera
```

### Import Errors
```bash
# Reinstall requirements
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Check Python version
python --version
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Close other applications
# Check system resources
# Use minimal requirements if needed
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ App loads in browser without errors
- ✅ Camera feed displays properly
- ✅ AI detection works for all phases
- ✅ Auto-parking completes successfully
- ✅ Data saves to CSV files
- ✅ Continuous detection cycle operates
- ✅ No console errors in browser
- ✅ No Python errors in terminal

## 🆘 Emergency Fallback

If deployment fails:
1. Use `requirements-minimal.txt` instead
2. Test with simple Streamlit app first
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify all files are in repository
5. Try local deployment before cloud
